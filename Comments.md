## Lecture 3 - Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)
**Reference:** [Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)](https://www.ted.com/talks/lies_damned_lies_and_statistics_about_tedtalks#t-316284)

The third lecture is a presentation about the insights gotten from a TED Talks data analysis.

After watching the video...
- What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?
- What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?
- Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen?
- Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?

The visulatizations that the the speaker used are very well thought and interesting. However, some of them have too much information which might be hard to grasp by the audience. I particularly liked the one where the ideal duration of the TED talk depending on different topics is given.

I think the speaker wants to show that even though statistics are very powerful, sometimes using them for everything might be a bad idea and lead to wrong conclusion. However, there is a lot of research behing his work and and in the end, certain aspects that he comments, such as the topic, duration, etc., might definitely contribute to the quality of a TED talk. 

The topic was quite interesting and the speaker makes the audience glued to the screen with a very lively talk.

The speaker gave a very complete talk. However, the talk is quite funny that the listener might actually  miss the point that he's trying to make.
